git branch <branch name>
change to branch using: git checkout <branch_name>

One liner to create a branch and move to it:
git checkout -b <branch_name>

see all branches:
git branch

to change back to main:
git checkout main

to add the branches to main:
git checkout main
git merge <branch_name>


to delete a branch you no longer need:
git branch -d <branch_name> -- if its already been merged with main
gid branch -D <branch_name> -- if it hasn't
